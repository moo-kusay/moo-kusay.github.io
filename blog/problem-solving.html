    <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
    
    <p><i>"Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to perceive, control, and evaluate emotions. Some researchers suggest
       that emotional intelligence can be learned and strengthened, while others claim it's an inborn characteristic." - Very Well Mind </i></p>

    <p>While it is crucial to be able to control and convey emotions, it is far better to have the ability to be aware, see, and react kindly, 
      understandably, and sympathise with the emotions of others without judgment, because we all get angry from time to time, and sometimes
      our anger is not towards others but ourselves, instead of judging someone emotions it is better to visualize whether 
      they have family problems or did something happened to them before they come into work or study or did something
      happened at work or at school. But sometimes it is our fault;  without looking within ourself we judge others, blame others or lash out at others.</p>

   <h3> Key signs and examples of emotional intelligence:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>An ability to identify and describe what people are feeling</li>
      <li>An awareness of personal strengths and limitations</li>
      <li>Self-confidence and self-acceptance</li>
      <li>The ability to let go of mistake</li>
      <li>An ability to accept and embrace change</li>
      <li>A strong sense of curiosity, particularly about other people</li>
      <li>Feelings of empathy and concern for others</li>
      <li>Showing sensitivity to the feelings of other people</li>
      <li>Accepting responsibility for mistakes</li>
      <li>The ability to manage emotions in difficult situations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Emotional Intelligence can be measured as follows:</h3>
    <p>There are different assessments for Emotional Intelligence but they normally falls under:</p>
    <p>Self-reported:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Easiest to administer and score</li>
      <li>Respondents rate their own behaviours by responding to questions or statements</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Ability tests:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Involve having people respond to situations</li>
      <li>Often require people to demonstrate their abilities</li>
      <li>Abilities are then been assess and rated by a third party</li>
    </ul>

      <p>Emotional intelligence test can be also administered by a mental health professional, and two measures may be used:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) is an ability-based test that 
        measures the four branches of Mayer and Salovey's EI model. Test-takers perform tasks designed to assess their ability to perceive, identify, understand, and manage emotions.</li>
      <li>Emotional and Social Competence Inventory (ESCI) is based on an older instrument known as the Self-Assessment Questionnaire and involves having people who know the individual 
        offer ratings of that person’s abilities in several different emotional competencies. The test is designed to evaluate the social and emotional abilities that help distinguish people as strong leaders.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Intelligence Quotient</h2>
    <p>Intelligence Quotient, shortly known as IQ is an intelligent test score, obtained by a standardised intelligence test in which an individual’s
       mental age is divided by his chronological age and then multiplied by 100. The test aims at assessing 
       a person’s cognitive capacity of thinking and reasoning. The term was first introduced by William Stern.</p>
    <p>Q is a measure of the intelligence level of an individual, that is reflected in the score obtained by the 
      person in the intelligence test as compared to the scores received by other people of the same age in the same test.</p>

    <h3>Key Differences Between IQ and EQ</h3>
    <p>The major differences between IQ and EQ are explained in detail in the following points:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>An individual’s level of emotional intelligence, which is represented by scores obtained in the standardized test, 
        is called Emotional Quotient or EQ. Intelligence Quotient or IQ is a number obtained from standardised intelligence test, 
        which represents an individual’s ability of logical reasoning.</li>

      <li>A person’s success in school depends on his IQ level, whereas a person’s EQ level reflects his success in real life.</li>

      <li>EQ measures an individual’s social and emotional competencies or one’s ability to recognise one’s own and 
        other person’s emotional expression. Conversely, IQ measures a person’s academic competency and reasoning ability.</li>

      <li>Emotional Quotient is acquired and improved. As opposed to intelligence quotient is an ability you are born with.</li>

      <li>A person with good EQ can recognise, control and express one’s own emotion’s, perceive and assess other’s emotions. 
      On the contrary, a person with a high IQ can learn, understand and implement knowledge, and possesses logical reasoning and abstract thinking.</li>

      <li>	6. High emotional intelligence can be seen in leaders, captains, managers and people with social challenges. Unlike,
         Intelligence quotient identifies people with high intellect, common sense, mental challenges, etc.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The IQ and EQ level are different in different persons. It is possible that a person has a high IQ level, 
      but low EQ count and vice versa. Therefore, the methods of checking IQ and EQ also differs.</p>
    <p>Your IQ is what determines your competencies and individual capacities, but your EQ determines how you interact 
      and treat people in your life, it shows how you are going to cope with pressures or face the crisis. The difference 
      between these two is that no one can alter his/her intelligence or reasoning abilities, but anyone can learn to handle emotions, to bring success for him.</p>
