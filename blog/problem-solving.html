    <h2>A story about:</h2>
    <h3>I - a time I was blocked on a simple problem..</h3>
    <p>
        Hmmm, this is tough, there's several but not much as a problem, but simple thing like typo, or 
        forgetting to put a comma in the code. In terms of a problem I was having in the challenge, it 
        was trying to find an average of an array for JavaScript Kata - Gradebook, I end up finding the 
        solution on Stack-Overflow while searching the internet. 
    </p>
    <h4>Solution Found on the Internet</h4>

    <h4>My Solution</h4>
    <img src="../assets/screenshots/average-of-an-array solution.png" alt="solution for finding an average of the array" width="500" height="600">
    <p>There were more, but that's one of the example, most of the solution I found was on the internet, W3Schools & StackOverflow.</p>

    <h3>II - a time I was elegantly solved a problem...</h3>
    <p>
        I guess the most easiest one was the Built-in (Array) Methods challenge; the concatMyArray, 
        returning or printing out a string. I simply wrote return arrayOfStrings.join('').

    <h2>Confidence on problem-solving techniques/processes</h2>
    <p>I haven't try most of the techniques/processes below.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pseudocode</strong></li>
        <p>I have yet to try this out, and as I get better at coding I'll try to use this often.</p>
        <li><strong>Trying something</strong></li>
        <p>This is something I do often, just trying out anything to see if it output something.</p>
        <li><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong></li>
        <p>
            I wasn't aware of this method before, but it makes sense now as I've been commenting some of code, 
            and just asking myself quetions when I do get stuck.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Reading error messages</strong></li>
        <p>I was doing these often when trying to do the Kata, and googling for answers.</p>
        <li><strong>Console.logging</strong></li>
        <p>This is one of the method I use often as well. </p>
        <li><strong>Googling/Searching the internet/Youtube</strong></li>
        <p>This is the main tool I use to find answers, but can't always find the right answers, have to spent a bit of time.</p>
        <li><strong>Asking your peers for help</strong></li>
        <p>
          Most of the questions I want to ask, have mostly been asked by other students on Discord, 
          looking through the messages help me with the inquires I have.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong></li>
        <p>
            I'm not sure if I'm comfortable asking the coaches much yet haha, I think I like to find answers on my own, 
            get my own understanding before asking peers or coaches. But I would love to during bootcamp as it's face to
            face and not online. Althought it may feels comfortable asking online for help but in person I say is much better.</p>
        <li><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong></li>
        <p>This is something I need to practice more of instead of advancing ahead.</p>
    </ul>
