    <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>hello</p>
    <ol>
      <!-- Q 1 -->
      <li><h3><i>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</i></h3></li>
      <p>My long term goal is to be a lifelong learner, to keep coding, and to learn DevOps, Cyber Security, and Cloud computing as hobbies.
         Career goal would be to learn all the ropes, and eventually be a software developer in DevOps, Cyber Security, and the Cloud domain.</p>
     <!-- Q 2-->
      <li><h3><i>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</i></h3></li>
      <p>My strenghts include perseverance: not giving up despite being behind, or finding difficulties in some topic, knowing my weaknesses; 
        like getting distracted, getting stuck in the rabbit hole, knowing when to ask for help and when I'm wrong.</p>

      <p>Limitations: my migraine can take 1 to 3 off my days. I've been cautious to not trigger my migraine.</p>
     <!-- Q 3-->
      <li><h3><i>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</i></h3></li>
      <p>I would like to improve my time management skill, reflections like journaling, and be disciplined in my learning journey.</p>
     <!-- Q 4-->
      <li><h3><i>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</i></h3></li>
      <p><i><strong>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</strong> </i></p>
      <p>To stick to the Learning Objectives, Learning Competencies, and Just-In-Time Learning.</p>
      <p>To be considerate, mindful, and to listen to others, practice empathy, and to treat others as one want to be treated.</p>

      <p><i><strong>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</strong> </i></p>
      <p>To be honest with myself, get real, and take action, and ask for help when needed, and notified facilitators when necessary.</p>

      <!-- Q 5-->
      <li><h3><i>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</i></h3></li>
      <p>Set realistic goal, commit to it, search the net for information, ask or search through discord to see if the problem have been solved by other students, to seek help straight away, and to not put it off in the last minute.</p>

      <!-- Q 6-->
      <li><h3><i>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</i></h3></li>
      <p>To be honest on my progression, behaviours, habits, and yellow flags, etc.</p>

      <!-- Q 7-->
      <li><h3><i>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</i></h3></li>
      <p>Currently in Auckland I allocate two hours for Church on Sunday, and a couple hours home fellowship with the church family, about five hours per week, maybe more once I moved to Wellington as I'll have to travel a bit.</p>
      <p>I'm also finishing off my study at Yoobee college during night time, and learning other things that will help me at Dev Academy.</p>
