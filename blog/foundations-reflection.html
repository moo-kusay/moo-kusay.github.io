    <h3>My feelings...</h3>
    <p>
        Wow, I can't believe the foundation fly by so quick and I am sure other students felt the same as well.
        My overall feeling and what I felt is that I can do so much better than the last five weeks, I felt I 
        let myself down, my fellow students down, which I could assist with a lot of things; however I am glad,
        happy, and proud to see that fellow students across the country are engaging, helping, and supporting 
        one another, wanting the best for another. Great mahi amongst the students, and staffs.  
    </p>

    <p>
        Last but not least, I felt like I let my lovely facilitators down, I know can do so much more, and I
        hope to take the experiences the last five weeks, and how I felt into the bootcamp, and in life to do 
        better, be better, not only for myself but others, individuals I met a long this journey of life. 

    </p>
    <p>Nevertheless, I am grateful, optimistic, and excited for the bootcamp, and for growth, and so on.</p>

      <!-- ####Q 1#### -->
      <li><h3><i>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</i></h3></li>
      <p>
          Hmmm, this is a great question and a hard one too, I guess the major one will be getting myself stuck
          in the rabbit hole. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly maybe overthinking or go overboard with what has been asked, and wasted 
        a lot of time thinking about how to complete a task instead of doing the task, despite imperfections,
        maybe afraid of imperfection, or failures, but learning about growth mindset or relearning about it
        really helps. 
      </p>
      <p>
         Lastly, coding, JavaScript or HTML,CSS is not hard as I can remember, trying to learn, research and explain
         the concepts to non-technical friends or through the blog, it helps me to grasp the topic much better. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of ego, I guess the inner judge want me to give up so many times, going through sickness,as well
        as with difficult topic. 
      </p>
     <!-- ####Q 2####-->
      <li><h3><i>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</i></h3></li>
      <p>
          Values that arrive from experiences help in learning and in programming by making you appreciate the beauty
          of learning new things, and in my case, programming. 
      </p>
      <p>
          Empathy helps in learning and in programming by making us aware that
