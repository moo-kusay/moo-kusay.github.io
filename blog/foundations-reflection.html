    <h3>My feelings...</h3>
    <p>
        Wow, I can't believe the foundation fly by so quick and I am sure other students felt the same as well.
        My overall feeling and what I felt is that I can do so much better than the last five weeks, I felt I 
        let myself down, my fellow students down, which I could assist with a lot of things; however I am glad,
        happy, and proud to see that fellow students across the country are engaging, helping, and supporting 
        one another, wanting the best for another. Great mahi amongst the students, and staffs.  
    </p>

    <p>
        Last but not least, I felt like I let my lovely facilitators down, I know can do so much more, and I
        hope to take the experiences the last five weeks, and how I felt into the bootcamp, and in life to do 
        better, be better, not only for myself but others, individuals I met a long this journey of life. 

    </p>
    <p>Nevertheless, I am grateful, optimistic, and excited for the bootcamp, and for growth, and so on.</p>

      <!-- ####Q 1#### -->
      <li><h3><i>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</i></h3></li>
      <p>
          Hmmm, this is a great question and a hard one too, I guess the major one will be getting myself stuck
          in the rabbit hole. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly maybe overthinking or go overboard with what has been asked, and wasted 
        a lot of time thinking about how to complete a task instead of doing the task, despite imperfections,
        maybe afraid of imperfection, or failures, but learning about growth mindset or relearning about it
        really helps. 
      </p>
      <p>
         Lastly, coding, JavaScript or HTML,CSS is not hard as I can remember, trying to learn, research and explain
         the concepts to non-technical friends or through the blog, it helps me to grasp the topic much better. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of ego, I guess the inner judge want me to give up so many times, going through sickness,as well
        as with difficult topic. 
      </p>
     <!-- ####Q 2####-->
      <li><h3><i>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</i></h3></li>
      <p>
          Values that arrive from experiences help or values role in learning and in programming by making you appreciate 
          the beauty of learning new things, and in my case, programming. 
      </p>
      <p>
          Empathy and self-awareness helps us or its role in learning and in programming by making us aware that we're learning 
          something new, something difficult, its role are to make us aware of our can or can't do, embrace, celebrate win, and
          knowing that we're not alone in this journey, there are other students well that may go through the same thing as us
          and all of us need each other support. 
      </p>

      
     <!-- ####Q 3####-->
      <li><h3><i>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</i></h3></li>
      <p>
          That we're missing this in our traditional school curriculum and that it should get
          implemented, students in our public school get throw together in public system without
          a tool or tools that actually teach them to manage their emotions, or get taught about
          how their brain work, and more importatly how to learn (learning how to learn), how to
          be self aware, and have empathy towards their fellow students, and themselves. 
      </p>
     <!-- Q 4-->
      <li><h3><i>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</i></h3></li>
      
      <p>
          Trying to put my learning or undersatnding of the topic into my own words or in a non 
          technical terms for non-technical people.
      </p>
    
      <!-- Q 5-->
      <li>
        <h3>
            <i>
                Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on 
                core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
            </i>
        </h3>
      </li>
      <p>
          To make us learn better,make us aware of ourselves,our bad habits, learning capabilities, 
          and to make aware of others, train us for the real world, and to say, overall so that we'll enjoy
          bootcamp as well learning a great skills and with like-minded individuals/students.
      </p>

      <!-- Q 6-->
      <li>
          <h3>
              <i>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
                Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
              </i>
          </h3>
      </li>
      <p>
          Not at all, trying to remember or grasp/retain the information and putting it in our words was
          more of a challenge than anything else, and at times it does feel like a waste of time but I can 
          see the important of it as we progress through the foundations.   
      </p>
