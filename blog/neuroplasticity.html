  <h2>Neuroplasticity | Brain Plasticity</h2>
    <p>
      <i>Neuroplasticity is the ability for our brain to change and adapt when we learn something 
         new or encounter different kinds of experience. And the often we do them, our wiring will
         become concrete whether bad or good. 
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Two types of neuroplasticity include:
      <ul>
          <li>
              <strong>Functional plasticity</strong> : new information can be stored from undamaged areas 
              of our brain from the damaged areas.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Structural plasticity</strong> : our brain can change by new learning new things.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  <h3>Principles</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age and Environment</strong> : our brain changes throughout our life, and through our environment</li>
        <li><strong>Ongoing Process</strong> : not fixed, brain never stops changing by learning</li>
        <li><strong>Limitations</strong> : some areas of our brain can recover while other areas can't be recover due to brain damage</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Capacity to learn new things</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Capability to improve previous skill or experience</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Healing from strokes and traumatic brain injuries</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Improve areas where function is lost or declined</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        By understanding neuroplasticity principles and its benefits, by understanding our changing brain, 
        we can benefits from it by intentionally changing our thoughts that are always against us, and when
        we are aware of the thought that are against us we can redirect our thought towards a positive thought,
        and as we keep redirecting our thoughts from bad to good, our new thoughts began to take place instead
        of the bad, self-defeating thoughts.  
    </p>
  <h4>Engaging with the principles of Neuroplasticity and increasing our Neuroplasticity</h4>
    <p>We can engage and improve our brain by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Enriching our environment : Learning new languages, learn to play instrument, traveling 
            and exploring new places, drawing, reading a book or reading a genre we never read before.
        </li>
        <li>
            Getting plenty of rest, exercising regularly, practice mindfulness and play games; board or vidoes games. 
        </li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
    <p>
      <i>
          "Growth mindset is a term coined by psychologist and leader in the field of motivation, Carol Dweck. 
          It is the idea that there is no permanency to what we do and do not know. This opposes the idea of 
          a fixed mindset, which is a belief that intelligence is directly linked to ability, and cannot be changed.
          With a growth mindset, anyone can learn anything." - Choice Schools
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Growth Mindset is important and relevant in our learning and to grow as a person, most of us are told we're 
        not good enough, whether as a young child or as an adolescence by our teachers or peers when we failed (and 
        when our peers views failure/s as failure/s and not as an opportunity to grow and learn).
    </p>
    <p>
        The worse critic of all is ourselves, these experiences can result into a <strong>fixed mindset</strong>, where 
        the thinking is rigid around our abilities, whether we are downright bad or good at certain tasks whereas a 
        <strong>growth mindset</strong> is having the optimism and the determination to keep going, and tackle challenges
        that come our way.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a growth mindset we can develop our abilities, the starting point of us having
        and developing a growth mindset is by believing that our abilities can be developed, 
        and by understanding that our natural intelligence and talent can grow.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        We can develope our growth mindset by incorporating our past experiences and set goals 
        that we can work towards, and when we cultivate it with practice and time, we can then 
        achieve the goals or skills that we want to have, as we keep practicing a growth mindset, 
        we will automatically tackle difficult problems when we face them. 

    </p>

    
  <h4>Surprises for me</h4>
    <p>
        I don't have much of a surprise by learning about growth mindset, since I am acquainted
        much with failtures and past unwise decisions, it has however reenforce my thinking
        by embracing shortcomings, failures and seeing it as an opportunity to learn, 
        to grow and to change direction, and to keep going.  
    </p>
  <h4>Ways to Develop Growth Mindset</h4>
    <p>Here's a few way we can integrate a growth mindset in our learning by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Admit and Cherish Our Imperfections</strong> : By doing this we can overcome the things we can't do (yet).</li>
        <li><strong>See Challenges as Opportunities</strong> : By doing this we can improve ourself</li>
        <li><strong>Think Outside the Box</strong> : There may be multiple solutions or different way to solve a single problem.</li>
        <li><strong>Understand brain Plasticity</strong> : our brain aren't fixed, it can adapt, and change</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Embrace Failures</strong> : see this as learning opportunities,
            we haven't failed providing we keep going and don't give up.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Personally for me, I will incorporate a growth mindest into my learning:</p>
       <ul>
          <li>By going easy on myself when I can not solve certain problems yet</li>
          <li>By redirecting my thought that I can do difficult things</li>
          <il>By seeing failures as an opportunity to learn and grow</il>
          <li>By keep learning despite setbacks</li>
       </ul>

        An article by Carol Dweck and Kathleen Hogan on how Microsoft Uses a Grwoth Mindset to Develop Leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
        I guess by learning that even talented and elite individuals at Microsoft are still learning and improving
        their growth mindset, I can do it too.

    <h2>Blending a Growth Mindset with my Learning Plan and Strategies</h2>
    <h4>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy</h4>
    <p>
        In terms of how its shape or influence my learning plan, and strategies, I'll say that by understanding that
        I can grow despite how difficult things may be or dozens setbacks I may have, I can keep learning and improve 
        myself and my skills by redirecting my negative thoughts that I should give up. And by not comparing my learning
        journey with others.
