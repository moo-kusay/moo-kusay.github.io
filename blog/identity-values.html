    <h2>Intersecting between the East, and the West</h2>
    <p>I values authenticity, kindness, empathy, love, forgiveness, understanding, and I believe in second chances while on this earth.</p>
      
      <p>My Identity, Values, and Strengths have been in the making for nearly three decades:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>From fleeing my motherland Kaw Thoo Lei to becoming a refugee due to war;
          a civil war in Burma/Myanmar (heartbrokenly it's still ongoing).</li>
        <li>From moving refugee camp to different refugee camps; several times and learning new languages, 
          settling into new home, new places, new school, making friends all over again.</li>
        <li>From resettling to New Zealand as a refugee</li>
        <li>From growing up in a Christian home to leaving the church to recommiting my life to Jesus and my Christian faith.</li>
        <li>From travelling abroad (eleven country) and meeting and talking to people from all walks of life, different culture, goals and dreams.</li>
        <br>
        <p>My life journey have been full-on, with difficulties and with many blessings,
         and I am greatful to God, to my friends and family and to kind, loving, considerate and selfless people I met along the way.</p>
        <p><i>*Kaw Thoo Lei is a land, a country that my people; Karen/K'nyaw are fighting to gain independence from the military dictatorship.</i></p>
      </ul>
      
    <!-- Question 1 -->
    <h2><i>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision,
    the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</i></h2>
    <h3>The Story</h3>
    <p>Man, this is tough, and I'm sure there are a lot but If I have to share one, it'll be an ATM story, 
    this happened a long time ago, maybe a decade ago, so the memory of my feeling, how I felt, I can't 
    recall hundred percent of it.
    
    <p>The story goes like this,I was going to the ATM to widthdraw some money, 
      as I went near the building, the alarm or sirens were going, I don't know what it was, as soon as I was by the ATM machine, I noticed that
      someone forgot to take their card out, and I have access full access to their account.</p> 
      
    <p>I didn't know what to do; whether to eject the card and inform the bank clerk, and use my own card,
      I had like a second to decide, I ended up widthdrawing around 500 or 600 feeling the guilt as I was widthdrawing, 
      and went on my merry way.</p> 
      
    <p>It happened so fast, I was young, I didn't have access to much money, didn't have a full-time job, didn't have a car, so I walk
      to a nearby park shortly after widthdrawing someone money, to catch up with friends, a cop car came by the park, 
      don't really know what or who they're looking for; probably me, haha. They left after, I didn't get arrested.</p>
    <p>I was sitting on the money for several days and didn't spent the money, my mind was racing, I was contemplating all sort of scenarios.</p>

    <h3>The Decision</h3>
    <p>I finally man-up and decided to do the right thing, by returning the money, and I did, I went to the bank, 
      asked to speak to the teller privately, and explained to her everything that has unfolded,
      it wasn't easy but I felt much better afterward.</p>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>Looking back at it now, I would say I've made the right decision, who knows what could have happened to me If I didn't return the money.</p> 
    <p>I guess that experience taught me:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>to do the right thing when I have the opportunity.</li>
        <li>to admit when I am in the wrong.</li>
        <li>that carrying guilt is a heavy burden.</li>
        <li>and that forgiveness, reconciliation, redemption and second chances is possible.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Question 2 -->
    <h2><i>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</i></h2>

    <p>My life intersect between the East, and the West, I lived over a decade and a half in the East; about four years in the motherland 
      and nine years in Thailand refugee camps, and nearly two decades in the West, so I'm very cross-cultural person.</p>

    <h3>A bit about Myanmar Culture</h3>
      
    <p>Burma/Myanmar is a multi-ethnic country, there's seven main ethnic groups and there are over one hundred languages spoken in Burma. So the different culture, food, and people have a big influence on my life.</p>

    <p>Across the ethnic culture, we respect the elders, and those who are older than us, we don't address them by name, if they are a teacher, 
      we call them teacher, or if they are older than us, we call them Sir, Ma'am, Uncle, Auntie, Big/Little sister or brother. And if there are elderly in the room, we always bowed our head if we need to walk across them.</p>

    <p>Since my life is interesect between the East, and the West, I still keep the East values dearly and embracing the West at the same time.</p>
    
    <h3>Refugee Life</h3>
    <p>I don't remember much about my childhood in Kaw Thoo Lei (Burma/Myanmar) but early on in life I'm blessed with different
      people of colour and culture.</p>
    
    <p>While being a refugee in Thailand, I've met different ethnic groups from Burma, 
     I've met Thai people, and many international community; relief volunteers around the world,
     before that I've only know the Karen People.</p>

    <h4>Experience as a Refugee</h4>
    <p>My experience as a young refugee kid was that, not everyone is the same, not everyone treat you the same, 
      and just because one or two people from a different race or ethnic group treat you badly doesn't make the whole ethnic group bad.
      
    <p>There was one time, I went to a Thai village as a young boy, and I was bully by a couple Thai young boys for being a refugee or being an ethnic from Burma.</p>

    <p>There's also another time when I went to a Thai village with my family and friends to eat out, buy food, groceries,
       and we were treated by a Thai lady with dignity and respect.</p>
    
    <p>And to add, among the relief workers, there were also Thai nationals, <i>one person kindness makes all the difference</i> and I guess I didn't grew up 
      hating one people group because I had a bad experience with one or two.</p>
    
    <h3>Closing</h3>

    <p>Last but not least, my Identity is in Jesus Christ, growing up in a Christian home wasn't always perfect, 
    I wasn't a Christian, my Christian walk wasn't always perfect, but the teachings and the life of Jesus have a major influence on my life.</p>

    <p>My Christian faith and all of these experiences have define who I am, and what I value today.</p>

    <p><i>"Do unto others as you would have them do to you." Jesus - Luke 6:31</i></p>
      
      <!-- Question 3 -->
    <h2><i>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</i></h2>

    <p>I have yet to discover my strength "strength" but I'll say it's:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Perseverance, despite procrastinating and finding how difficult things may be - I always finish what I set my heart on.</li>
        <li>Curiosity - I love to learn all things.</li>
        <li>Multi-tasking - I'd improve this skill from working in a fast-pace environment, and from delegating people.</li>
        <li>Knowing my weaknesses and being honest with myself regarding my skills.</li>
        <li>Knowing when to ask for help</li>
      </ul>
       

    <!-- Question 4 -->
    <h2><i>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</i></h2>

    <p>My limitations in terms of my learning may be migraine and procrastination or not saying no; to friends or family or to myself:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Migraine: this is something I can't control, I started to have migraine since 2014, 
        but I can avoid or reduce my migraine by elimating the triggers one by one. 
        These can affect my learning journey by one to three days sometimes, 
        I can reflect this on my work sick leave; the majority of the sick leave was due to migraine.</li>
      <li>Procrastination: I have yet to kill the procrastination habits</li>
      <li>Not saying no: I'm the type of person that love to help people and put other first or at least I'm trying to, 
        this can put my goal or the things I want to achieve on hold. But ultimately not saying no to myself;
        like withholding the desire to play my new favorite games, or tv shows.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>In terms of career development, I'll say fear or the inner judge:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fear: I was too comfortable where I was, fear of rejection, or failures, but I have since learn that we can only grow by trying something new, and by failing often.</li>
        <li>Inner judge: my private enemy number one!</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Question 5 -->
    <h2><i>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies 
      you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</i></h2>
    <p>There were many but I'll say clear communication, and getting everyone understanding the tasks 
      they be doing, and something that the love to do and something that they are good at.</p>
    <p>And listen to others more, and talk less, then give opinion.</p>
    <p>This is something that I'll keep doing.</p>
